         The data deviates for every tremor that happened to date as per the figures obtained from various sites such as Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER), Quake Watch, USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, etc...  Thousands are deceased and wounded, million get dislocated, while a notable amount goes missing and stray. Earthquake’s linkage with structural impairment and loss of life keeps on persisting and hence is the focal issue of consideration for numerous domains, such as environmental engineering and seismological analysis. 
         
         Consequently, the effects of an earthquake are devastating and are not confined to loss and damage of living as well as nonliving, but it also causes a substantial portion of transformation, from economic and lifestyle to environment. 
        
        To name a few, Shaanxi( China), Port‑au‑Prince(Haiti), Antakya(Turkey), etc.,  have witnessed many devastating tremors, which resulted in plenty of cessations, structural damage, and economic misfortunes.

        Incalculable dollars and careers have been devoted to anticipating where and when the upcoming enormous quake will hit.
        Compared to climate forecasting, which has remarkably enhanced with the benefit of more robust mathematical pinnacles and sounder satellites,  tremor foretelling has been tainted by persistent failures due to exceptionally sceptical conditions of the planet and its surroundings.

        As innovation is advancing and assisting people for a remarkably favourable and suitable way of life, the ability to save a life is explored with the assistance of a quick propelling field of Data Science.

        Essentially, data science tools could be deployed into a perpetual ordeal while reckoning such a vital societal peril issue. The yearning of this work is that the data-driven estimation would furnish better insights into the earthquake affair. 

        Thus, prior notice can help people attempt to safeguard themselves from harm and demise; can lessen damage and monetary adversities, and property can be secured.

        Time series forecasting is one of the most applied data science techniques in business, finance, supply chain management, production and inventory planning. 
        Many prediction problems involve a time component and thus require extrapolation of time series data, or time series forecasting. 
        Time series forecasting is also an important area of machine learning (ML) and can be cast as a supervised learning problem. 
        Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. 
        It predicts future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

        Prophet is an open-source machine learning algorithm developed by Facebook for producing time-series models that utilize a couple of old thoughts for certain new twists.
        It is a methodology for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, and holiday influences. It works best with time series having vigorous seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
