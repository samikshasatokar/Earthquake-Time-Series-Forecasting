 ## Aim
     The project aims to build a web application to analyse and forecast the magnitude
     and depth of future earthquake events using Time Series Forecasting. 
     The prototype includes algorithms such as Facebook Prophet, Regression,
     and Long Short term Memory Network for making forecasts, and Streamlit framework to 
     design the user interface. 
     The mean square error (MSE) is used to estimate the accuracy of each model.
